\section{Rules}
Reject incorrect solutions from your teammates. Try to find counterexamples.

Discuss implementation and try to simplify the solution.

Avoid getting stuck on the problem.

Regularly discuss how many problems need to be solved and what steps to take, starting from the middle of the contest.

At the end of the contest, try to find a problem with an easy implementation.

\section{Troubleshoot}
\textbf{Pre-submit}\\
F9.
Create a few manual test cases.
Calculate time and memory complexity. Check the limits.
Be careful with overflows, constants,
clearing mutitestcases, and uninitialized variables.

\textbf{Wrong answer}\\
F9.
Print your solution!
Read your code.
Check pre-submit.
Are you sure your algorithm works?
Consider precision errors and hash collisions.
Ensure you have understood the problem correctly.
Write the brute-force solution and the test case generator.

\textbf{Runtime error}\\
F9.
Print your solution!
Read your code.
F9 with generator.
Check for memory limit exceeded.

\textbf{Time limit exceeded}\\
What is the complexity of your algorithm?
Are you copying a lot of unnecessary data? (References)
Do you have any infinite loops?
Use arrays, unordered maps instead of vectors and maps.
