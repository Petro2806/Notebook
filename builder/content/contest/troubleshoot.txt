Pre-submit:
F9.
Write a few manual test cases.
Calculate time and memory complexity. Check limits.
Check overflows, size of arrays, 
clearing mutitestcases, uninitialized variables.

Wrong answer:
F9.
Print your solution!
Read your code.
Check Pre-submit.
Are you sure your algorithm works?
Think about precision errors and hash collitions.
Have you understood the problem correctly?
Write brute and generator.


Runtime error:
F9.
Print your solution!
Read your code.
F9 with generator.


Time limit exceeded:
What is the complexity of your algorithm?
Are you copying a lot of unnecessary data? (References)
Do you have any possible infinite loops?
How big is the input and output? (consider scanf)
Avoid vector, map. (use arrays/unordered_map)

Memory limit exceeded:
Calculate memory usage with stack in recurtion.
