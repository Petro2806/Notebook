\section{Troubleshoot}
\subsubsection{Pre-submit}
F9.
Create a few manual test cases.
Calculate time and memory complexity. Check the limits.
Be careful with overflows, constants,
clearing mutitestcases, uninitialized variables.

\subsubsection{Wrong answer}
F9.
Print your solution!
Read your code.
Check pre-submit.
Are you sure your algorithm works?
Think about precision errors and hash collisions.
Have you understood the problem correctly?
Write the brute and the generator.

\subsubsection{Runtime error}
F9.
Print your solution!
Read your code.
F9 with generator.
Memory limit exceeded.

\subsubsection{Time limit exceeded}
What is the complexity of your algorithm?
Are you copying a lot of unnecessary data? (References)
Do you have any infinite loops?
Use arrays, unordered maps instead of vectors and maps.
