\section*{Newton's method}

Usable to find the solution of equation $F(Q) = 0$.

For example $F(Q) = x \cdot Q^2 + A - Q = 0$.

Newton's method approximates the solution of the equation using the formula: 
$$Q_{k + 1} = Q_{k} - \frac{F(Q_k)}{F'(Q_k)}, where\; F' = \frac{dF}{dQ}$$

Example of the derivative: $F'(Q) = 2 \cdot x \cdot Q - 1$.

Keep in mind that $|Q_{k}| = 2^k$.
