\subsection{Burnside's lemma}

Let $G$ be a finite group that acts on a set $X$.

The \textit{orbit} of an element $x$ in $X$ is the set of elements
in $X$ to which $x$ can be moved by the elements of $G$.
The orbit of $x$ is denoted by $G \cdot x$:

 \[G \cdot x = \{g \cdot x\, |\, g \in G\}.\]

For each $g$ in $G$, let $X^g$ denote the set of elements
in $X$ that are fixed by $g$ (also said to be left invariant by $g$),
that is, $X^g = \{ x \in X\, |\, g \cdot x = x \}$.
Burnside's lemma asserts the following formula for the number of orbits,
denoted $|X/G|$:

\[|X/G| = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} |X^g|.\]
