\section{Ptolemy's theorem}
If the cyclic quadrilateral is $ABCD$, then
\[AC \cdot BD = AB \cdot CD + AD \cdot BC\]

\section{Ceva's theorem}
Given a triangle $\triangle ABC$ with a point $P$ inside the triangle,
continue lines $AP$, $BP$, $CP$ to hit $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ at $D$, $E$, $F$,
respectively.
Ceva's theorem states that
\[\frac{AF}{FB} \cdot \frac{BD}{DC} \cdot \frac{CE}{EA} = 1.\] 

\section{Simson line}
Given a triangle $\triangle ABC$ and a point $P$ on its circumcircle,
the three closest points to $P$ on lines $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$ are collinear.
The line through these points is the Simson line of $P$.

\section{Euler line}
The line on which the orthocenter, triangle centroid, circumcenter,
and a number of other important triangle centers lie.
