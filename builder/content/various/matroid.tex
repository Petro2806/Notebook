\section*{Matroid}

In terms of independence, a finite matroid $M$ is a pair $(E, I)$, where 
$E$ is a finite set (called the ground set) and 
$I$ is a family of subsets of $E$ (called the independent sets) 
with the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The empty set is independent, i.e., $\emptyset \in I$;
\item Every subset of an independent set is independent, i.e., for each $A' \subseteq A \subseteq E$, if $A \in I$ then $A' \in I$;
\item If $A, B \in I$, and $|A| > |B|$, then there exists $x \in A \setminus B$ such that $B \cup \{ x \} \in I$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Rado-Edmonds algorithm}
We have matroid $M = (X, I)$, where each element $x \in X$ has some weight and 
we have to find a maximum size basis with minimum total weight.

To solve this problem use the following algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort all elements from $X$ by their weight;
\item Consider all elements $x \in X$ in sorted order and include them in $S$ if $S \cup \{ x \} \in I$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Matroid intersection}
Matroids intersection of several matroids $M_1 = (X, I_1), \, M_2 = (X, I_2), \, \dots , \, M_k = (X, I_k)$ defined on the same ground set $X$ represents “good” subsets as an intersection
$I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \dots \cap I_k$. 
The task is to find a set of objects $S \subseteq X$ with maximum size such that $S \in (I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \dots \cap I_k)$. 

Intersection of \textbf{three} or more matroids in \textbf{NP-complete} task.
However, the intersection of two matroids can be done in polynomial time.

We can increase the size of $S$ by one. To do this, let’s build the following directed bipartite graph. 
The left part of this graph will contain all objects from $S$, while the right part will contain all other objects from $X \ A$.

Consider objects from the right part of the graph such that adding them into $S$ keeps independence in $I_1$. 
Let’s paint these objects in green. Similarly, paint in a red color objects that keeps independence in $I_2$.

Let’s add an edge from the left vertex $u$ to the right vertex $v$ when $S \setminus \{ u \} \cup \{ v \} \in I_1$.
Symmetrically let’s add an edge from the right vertex $v$ to the left vertex $u$ when $S \setminus \{ u \} \cup \{ v \} \in I_2$.

\end{center}

Let’s find the shortest path from some green vertex to some red vertex. 
Objects on the path are added or removed from the set $S$, respectively, objects from the right part are added and the left part is removed.

The weighted version of this task is to find a corresponding set $S$ with maximum size but also with minimum total weight of objects.
In this case, we have to find the shortest weighted path, that can be done using the Ford-Bellman algorithm.

\subsection*{Matroid union}

Some problems of matroid union can be transformed into matroid intersection.
For example, in the problem of finding $k$ pairwise disjoint spanning trees, we can copy our graph $k$ times. 
Then we have two matroids: the "forest" matroid and the "colorful" matroid.
