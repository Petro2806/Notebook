\section{Lader nim}
Players have stone piles of size a0, a1, ..., an.
In one move player can take 0 < x <= ai stones 
from i-th pile and move them to (i-1)-th pile.

In this game you can forget about even piles.
Take stones from odd is equal to remove in NIM
and from even equal to add in NIM.
Adding in NIM useless.
