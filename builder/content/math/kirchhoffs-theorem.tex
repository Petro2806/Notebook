\subsection{Kirchhoff's theorem}

Let $G$ be a finite graph, allowing multiple edges but not loops.

The laplacian matrix $L$ of $G$ is the $n \times n$ matrix whose
$(i, j)$-entry $L_{i j}$ is given by
\begin{displaymath}
L_{i j} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
-m_{i j}, & \textrm{if $i \ne j$, $m_{i j}$ edges between $v_i$ and $v_j$, } \\
\deg(v_i), & \textrm{if $i = j$.}
\end{array} \right.
\end{displaymath}

Let $L_0$ denote $L$ with the $i$-th row and column removed for any $i$.
Then for a connected graph, $\det(L_0)$ equals the number of spanning trees of $G$.
