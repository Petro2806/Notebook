\subsection{Recover}
\subsubsection{Min cut}
To restore min cut use search from S on edges with flow $\ne$ capacitie. 
Original edges from used vertices to unused is minimal cut.


\subsubsection{Min cover}
Only in bipartite graphs.
Minimum number of vertex to cover edges equal to size of mathing.

To restore min cover make directed graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item mathced edges direct from R to L
\item unmathced edges direct from L to R
\end{itemize}

From unmathced vertices from left do search.
In cover take from vertices in mathcing:
\begin{itemize}
\item unvisited vertices in L 
\item visited vertices in R
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Max independent set}
Only in bipartite graphs.

Maximal independent set is complement of vertex cover
